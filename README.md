Voice commands requires pc and mic


First download this file once launched
And setup you can make your computer commit to tasks 
Based on words you say such as type time set 22 

So once set up you want to create a new command word something like start 
A command that will enable it , after that you want to show what the command does 
So here you want it to enable voice 

After that you want to make another command one that works on Alta dashboard so u load Alta dash 
Then once in command runner you make the command eg set day
Now set that command to type time set day so every time you say set day it types that command 
Now just start it by saying start then say set day and it will type it into the command runner for you 


This is only the trial version for the full version with better software dm me in discord
